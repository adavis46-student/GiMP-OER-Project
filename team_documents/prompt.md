# Assignment Description for Project 2

<h1>Context</h1>
The second unit in Writing 350 focuses on two very important concepts related to digital literacy and composition. The theme of this unit is free/open source culture: our readings and class discussions will explore what the movement is all about, its pros and cons, and its larger societal implications for intellectual property, copyright, education, and the economy. The deliverable for the unit will be a collaboratively produced documentation set for a free or open-source project. That’s right, this is a group project. You will learn about the technical communication workflow as you develop documentation or learning modules (depending on your approach). At the conclusion of the unit, you will present your work to the class as a group. 

<h1>Assignment</h1>
Your groups for this project will be pre-assigned. Your group’s first task will be to choose an open-source tool, application, resource, or project to write about. Documentation probably already exists for whatever you choose, so what makes your project different will be audience. Your documentation set will specifically target college students (this also means that it is important to choose something that has some applicability to college students). Your documentation set will include three components: 

<ol>
<li>Primary user guide</li>
<li>One video demonstration or screencast</li>
<li>Curated list of links/resources for further reading </li>

You’ll compose, store, and publish your documentation set on our class DokuWiki server (www.digitalwriting.net) and use GitHub repositories to document your work.
